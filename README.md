# SwarmLinguisticOrder
The goal of this project is to enable swarms of Thymio robots to assess if their environment is adequate frequency-based for words and 
syntactically for sentences.
The project is divided into the following stages:
  1) Letters (user assembly dependent): each robot is assigned a letter of a word. The user assembles the robots in any order in a line.
                                        The robots communicate their values and use frequencies of letter sequences to determine how 
                                        happy they are in their current position. They will then show this by changing colour accordingly
                                        and walking off they are too unhappy. The user can reorder them at any time
  2) Word order (user assembly dependent): each robot is assigned a word and uses predefined constructions to determine if the order of
                                           robots is grammatical. The user can reassemble them at any time - NEXT STAGE
  3) Word order feedback - TODO
  4) Word order correction - TODO
  5) Word order (independent assembly) - TODO
